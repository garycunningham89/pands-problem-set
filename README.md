Work for Module in Programming and Scripting
Kept up to date with the content in the lecture videos and thought I had the grasp of programming and scripting as a complete beginner.
Began the problem set the week after it was released. And realised I had no idea what I was doing.
I took a break and focused on following content and completing exercises in other modules.
Came back at the beginning of March and it took quite a while to complete problem 1 as I wanted to try my own algorithms and input unique codes. Found this very difficult so then I began looking at supplementary reading and resources.
Solutions 1 was completed with the help of class content and python.org tutorials.
Solution 2 I had continued trying to learn as much about Python as possible before returning to the problem set but still had a difficult time creating the solution. I finally had a eureka moment when completing the Begins with T program. I done a lot of interactive tutorial work on w3schools.com and I found these very helpful and hope to use these alongside other resources to learn and understand further.
