Work for Module in Programming and Scripting
Kept up to date with the content in the lecture videos and thought I had the grasp of programming and scripting as a complete beginner.
Began the problem set the week after it was released. And realised I had no idea what I was doing.
I took a break and focused on following content and completing exercises in other modules.
Came back at the beginning of March and it took quite a while to complete problem 1 as I wanted to try my own algorithms and input unique codes. Found this very difficult so then I began looking at supplementary reading and resources.
Solutions 1 was completed with the help of class content and python.org tutorials.

Solution 2 I had continued trying to learn as much about Python as possible before returning to the problem set but still had a difficult time creating the solution. I finally had a eureka moment when completing the Begins with T program. I done a lot of interactive tutorial work on w3schools.com and I found these very helpful and hope to use these alongside other resources to learn and understand further.

Solution 3 submission. Gary Cunningham 20/03/2019.
Found the formatting getting easier and the algorithm constructed was done by;
1. Learning to get divisors of any number.
2. Testing it in both 1000 and 10000 and then as part of the range.
3. Finding function of lambda and how it is constructed from various learning resources but mainly w3schools.com.
4. Compiling and testing the program using range (), list (), filter () and lambda () as well as using the "%", "and" and "and not" to accurately produce output.  

Solution 4 was completed with a lot of class tutorial content and the code basis was built alone through trial and error. The difficulty arose in using the newly seen functions def(), especially the recalling of it and the while loop and I had to consult w3schools and python.org for further information, which was there was quite an amount for this program and the processes contained.

Solution 5 for the prime numbers was the first program which I attempted almost entirely by myself from reusing variations of learned class content and processes from Solutions 1 - 4. The "Eureka moment" has given confidence in programming and Python. Reused the def() function and completed it using if, elif and else statements. Tested function using a range of inputs to see if they were outputted as correctly as prime numbers or not.
