Solution 3 submission. Gary Cunningham 20/03/2019.
Found the formatting getting easier and the algorithm constructed was done by;
1. Learning to get divisors of any number.
2. Testing it in both 1000 and 10000 and then as part of the range.
3. Finding function of lambda and how it is constructed from various learning resources but mainly w3schools.com.
4. Compiling and testing the program using range (), list (), filter () and lambda () as well as using the "%", "and" and "and not" to accurately produce output.
